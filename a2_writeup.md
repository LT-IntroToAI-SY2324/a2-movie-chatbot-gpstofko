# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
The percentage aspect of the match function was the most difficult, but especially fulfilling all the certain conditions while having the other conditions working was hard because I would have to keep going back and fixing errors as fulfilling one assert would break another.


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
I could use the match function and input patterns for responses for common phrases and then use input to extract data and find differences between the pattern and input to pull differences.
